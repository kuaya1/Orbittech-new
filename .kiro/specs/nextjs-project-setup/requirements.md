# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up a new Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS styling. The project will follow modern development practices with a clean directory structure, including a `src` directory for better organization, dedicated folders for components and styles, and proper configuration for development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a new Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, so that I can build type-safe React applications with the latest Next.js features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL use Next.js version 14.x
2. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL configure TypeScript as the primary language
3. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include all necessary TypeScript configuration files
4. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL include proper type definitions for Next.js and React

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Tailwind CSS integrated into my Next.js project, so that I can use utility-first CSS classes for rapid UI development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL install and configure Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN Tailwind is set up THEN the system SHALL include the Tailwind configuration file
3. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL configure PostCSS for Tailwind processing
4. WHEN Tailwind is integrated THEN the system SHALL include Tailwind directives in the global CSS

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure with a `src` directory, so that I can maintain clean separation of concerns and follow modern Next.js conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL use a `src` directory structure
2. WHEN the src directory is created THEN the system SHALL move the `app` directory inside `src`
3. WHEN the project structure is set up THEN the system SHALL maintain Next.js 14 app router functionality
4. WHEN the directory structure is created THEN the system SHALL preserve all Next.js routing capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dedicated folders for components and styles, so that I can organize my code efficiently and maintain reusable UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a `src/components` folder
2. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL create a `src/styles` folder
3. WHEN the components folder is created THEN the system SHALL be ready to house reusable UI components
4. WHEN the styles folder is created THEN the system SHALL contain global CSS files including Tailwind imports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper package.json scripts and dependencies, so that I can run development, build, and other common tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL include standard Next.js development scripts
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL include all required packages for Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN the package.json is configured THEN the system SHALL include proper dev dependencies for TypeScript compilation
4. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL be ready to run `npm run dev` for development mode
